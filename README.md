# Introduction
This project is a robot extracting and analyzing KYC (Know-Your-Customer)
relevant information from various online sources. These sources include:
- UN, EU and OFAC sanctions for legal and natural persons
- Europol and Interpol wanted lists for natural persons
- General country risk assessment

The setup should be quite straightforward simply open the project in UIPath
studio and run the `Main.xaml` file. In some cases it might be necessary to
update a few variables which we will look at in the different workflows.

# Workflows
The project is divided in several sub workflows to facilitate maintenance and
improve readability. The different workflows are presented in the following
sections.

## Main
Wrapper for all the other workflows. Triggers the initial UI dialog and
consolidates the results into an Excel file.

### Important Variables
- `fileName`: Contains the path of the output file. By default contains the name
of the organization or person and a timestamp and is stored in the current
working directory

## Identify Person
Requests user input for the check of natural persons. Displays the UI and
returns the names, birth date and nationality.

### Important Variables
- `OUT: firstName`: Contains the entered first name
- `OUT: lastName`: Contains the entered last name

- `OUT: riskReason`: Reason for the assigned risk level. Contains a reference to
an UN sanction code

## EU Sanction List
Downloads, deserializes and searches the list of EU sanctions for matches with

- `OUT: riskReason`: Reason for the assigned risk level. Contains a reference to
an OFAC the corresponding list and rekevant program

## Country Risks
Evaluates the risks for a country based on a static Excel list which was taken
from (here)[https://www.eulerhermes.com/content/dam/onemarketing/ehndbx/eulerhermes_com/en_US/documents/other/EH-CountryRiskReport-Apr21.pdf].

### Important Variables
